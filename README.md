One of the daily decisions people make is figuring out what they will eat for a meal. This might seem minor, but it takes time finding out what you have in the pantry or your fridge and coming up with a recipe. The latter can be quite challenging for those who do not enjoy cooking or those who cannot eat the same dish for the consecutive meals. 
That is why we came up with a solution - a web application that recommends recipes based on what you currently have in your kitchen. Our target audience is young adults who do not know what to cook or want to explore new recipes.
